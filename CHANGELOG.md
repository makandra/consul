## 1.0.3 - 2019-09-23

### Security fix

This releases fix a security issue where in a controller with multiple `power` directives, the `:only` and `:except` options of the last directive was applied to all directives.

Affected code looks like this:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  power :foo
  power :bar, only: :index

  ...
end
```

In this example both the powers `:foo` and `:bar` were only checked for the `#index` action. Other actions were left unprotected by powers checks.

Controllers with a single `power` directive are unaffected.
Contollers where neither `power` uses `:only` or `:except` options are unaffected.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2019-16377.


### Compatible changes
